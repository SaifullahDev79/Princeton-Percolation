# Princeton-Percolation
Percolation Simulation (Princeton Algorithms I)

This project implements the classic percolation problem using the Union-Find data structure with path compression and weighting.

The goal is to estimate the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation while meeting strict API and performance constraints.

Key concepts:

Union-Find with path compression

Avoiding backwash using two disjoint UF structures

Monte Carlo simulation

Clean API design and edge-case handling

This implementation was written from scratch after reasoning through the assignment specification and validating correctness via the official autograder
